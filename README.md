#Scrappy Event and Engagement Application

## Our Goal

This project targets the CCSE department; this application aims to improve student engagement; KSU offers an extensive array of social, personal development, and career events on campus. The CCSE department would like to make these resources more accessible for students to use.


## What we created

The final product of this project is a fully working mobile application. This application hosts information about all KSU events in a reliable & efficient manner. All the event information is relayed to the user in an intuitive format that allows for ease of exploration of the KSU community.​
